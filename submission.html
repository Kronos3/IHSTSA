			<h3>SciVis</h3>
			<p>One of the events that IHSTSA only recently began to get involved in is SciVis (Scientific Visualization), an event that tasks participants communicate through 2D or 3D computer graphics a STEM topic or concept. The IHS SciVis team, headed by animation wizard Joseph Yoon ’19, consistently produces high-quality submissions that have resulted in top finishes at the national conference. In 2016, their animation about stem cells earned the team (composed completely of freshmen) a 4th place finish. Various animators have reached out to Joseph on his YouTube channel, which features all of his animation projects, for advice on how to tackle this challenging event.</p>

			<h3>Dragster</h3>
			<p>Dragster is one of the most popular and competitive events at Ithaca High School. Every year, students race each other in the chapter, simply to choose certain students to represent the chapter at conferences. Luckily, freshman Jacob Yoon, winner of 4th place in Dragster Design in Orlando, Florida. Jacob hopes to have similar success this year in Connecticut and Georgia. At a state level, our dragsters continually have success. For the past few years, Ithaca High School has also garnered fame from Deven Butler’s dragsters, which continually represent strength in aerodynamics and design. Together, Deven, Jacob, and newer members to the event hope to form a formidable coalition of Ithaca dragster entries at our upcoming events.</p>
