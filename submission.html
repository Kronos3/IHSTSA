    <h3>Great Submissions</h3>
    <p>IHSTSA got off to a late start this year, and since the early submission deadline is so early, few events are very far along. But below are a few of what we think will be our chapters awesomest submissions.</p>
    <p class="officer-header">Video Game Design - 2043</p>
    <p>Designed by six new IHSTSA members, this game is essentially a space shooter with a twist: in addition to defending against hordes of oncoming baddies, players must also exercise careful resource management, which necessitates clear thinking under a lot of stress. If the game goes on to be submitted at nationals, the team plans to rewrite its physics to obey Newton’s first law of motion, which in space means that objects don’t require constant force—or in the game’s case, a constant key press—to move at a constant velocity. According to team leader Aidan Foley, this will also “force players to think about what would actually happen in space. I mean, Star Wars physics are just really wrong.”</p>
    <p class="officer-header">Catapult</p>
    <p>IHSTSA has two catapult teams, each formed from a few TSA newbies and people from last year’s catapult team, which handily won at states with a “catapult” that was essentially a compressed air gun capable of rapid fire with a gravity fed magazine.</p>
    <p>With many people on each team taking AP Physics C, the ability to bring physics into each catapult’s design will prove extremely useful. Both teams are able to work backwards from the intended parabola of the golf ball the catapult must shoot to determine aspects of the catapults’ firing mechanisms, like how powerful springs must be and how far they must be stretched. While this is great is great for designing catapults before they’re built, it also means that neither team has put anything together or even started much CAD due to working out the physics first.</p>
    <p>One design is to have an arm powered by an electric motor spinning inside spiral tracks. As a golf ball is moved out from the center of the spiral, its speed increases due to the increased distance from the arms point of rotation. The other design is essentially a pinball machine where the spring is pulled back by an electric motor winding a bike chain around a gear with only one tooth. When the gear’s tooth isn’t touching the bike chain during half of its revolution, the bike chain can slip over the smooth part of the gear, releasing the spring and letting the catapult fire. Both catapults will feature gravity-fed magazines to speed reload.</p>
    <p class="officer-header">Children’s Stories</p>
    <p>IHSTSA members first competed in Children’s Stories at the 2015 National Conference, and made it into the semifinals. Since then, it’s become a staple event of IHSTSA. This year, the story is about the fictional daughter of the architect behind the Chrysler building. While the plot isn’t solidly down yet, we were told that the protagonist uses an asparagus for inspiration (think about it: the building and the vegetable look surprisingly similar). This year’s team, which is not too different from that which got to the semifinals earlier, is hard hard at work to make something cool.</p>
