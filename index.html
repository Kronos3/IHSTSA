    <p>IHSTSA won High School Chapter of the Year at the most recent state conference.</p>

<div class="intro">
    <h3>Who we are</h3>
    <p>Aspiring engineers. Aspiring scientists. Students aspiring to
technical excellence in pursuit of a better world. IHSTSA members push the
envelope when it comes to STEM education in order to better prepare
themselves for the future.</p>
    <h3>What we do</h3>
    <p>IHSTSA is one of the many chapters that make up the Technology Student Association in the New York. For years, IHSTSA has been a standout organization that helps young high school students realize and explore their dreams in STEM. Around 30 students identify as IHSTSA members.</p>
    <p>We pride ourselves in being great. For two years in a row, IHSTSA has won High School Chapter of the Year at the State Conference. Moreover, almost every single one of our students placed in at least one event at the State Conference. At the National Conference, our success does not stop. Annually, our chapter places in several events and semifinals in two times more.</p>
    <p>But we go beyond winning, seeding younger kids’ interest in STEM. Along with another tech club from Ithaca High School, we present at the STEM fairs held several times each year in our school district. Though it’s since sprung a few leaks, our winning pneumatic catapult design always manages to hold great interest.</p>
    <p>Of course, IHSTSA is meant to be a fun place for aspiring scientists, engineers, and other STEM-oriented people to grow and have fun.</p>

                    <p>Ithaca High School wouldn’t be nearly as cool as it is without its technology, math, and science departments. Without them, the future scientists and engineers studying here wouldn’t be nearly as capable, and IHSTSA’s students would have an extremely difficult time in any event. Luckily, these departments are quite probably the school’s strongest.</p>
