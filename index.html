    <p>IHSTSA won High School Chapter of the Year at the most recent state conference.</p>

    <h3>Who we are</h3>
    <p>Aspiring engineers. Aspiring scientists. Students aspiring to
technical excellence in pursuit of a better world. IHSTSA members push the
envelope when it comes to STEM education in order to better prepare
themselves for the future.</p>
    <h3>What we do</h3>
    <p>Fundamentally, IHSTSA is one of the many chapters that make up the Technology Student
Association in the New York. For years, IHSTSA has been a standout organization that helps
young high school students realize their dreams and design goals in STEM. Around 30 students
identify as a member of IHSTSA. However, many of these students take no engineering course
in school. Instead, these students have found their love in the countless events in TSA and the
teamwork involved in the chapter.</p>
    <p>That’s IHSTSA’s purpose, clear and simple. We don’t spend time on holding meetings with
parliamentary procedure; we believe the best use of our time is learning more about STEM. In
addition, we focus on benefitting the community by doing community service--helping out at
marathons, STEM demonstrations, and going to schools to help young kids learn about
technology. With many IHSTSA alumni going on to study in STEM fields at top-notch colleges,
such as UC Berkeley and Cornell University, all IHSTSA members go on to changing the world
for the better. Our chapter plays a vital role in preparing students for real-world scenarios that
can lead to world changing discoveries and contributions to STEM.</p>
    <p>We pride ourselves in being great. For two years in a row, IHSTSA has won High School
Chapter of the Year at the State Conference. Moreover, almost every single one of our students
placed in at least one event at the State Conference. At the National Conference, our success
does not stop. Annually, our chapter places in various events and semifinals in two times more.</p>
    <p>However, our main goal as a chapter is to have fun. TSA is supposed to be a place to meet new
friends, create new connections, and enjoy creating the best projects possible. As students are
aspiring to be scientists, doctors, engineers, and teachers, IHSTSA offers a fun medium when it
comes to working with others and developing skills in technology.</p>
