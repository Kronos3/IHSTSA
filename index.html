      <p>(Making technology awesome)</p>
      <p>It’s not the motto that the national Technology Student Association uses, but we feel it most accurately expresses what we do at Ithaca High School TSA. The decision to write it in a binary format was made to reflect our nerdiness.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="creed">
      <h1>Creed</h1>
      <p>Ithaca High School TSA uses a modified version of the Technology Student Association’s motto. We’ve been working up the courage to make a resolution at the national business meeting to change it to what we believe is not only better written, but also secular and not limited to only America.</p>
      <p><i>The Technology Education holds an important place in our lives in the technical world. There is a need for the development of good attitudes concerning work, tools, materials, experimentation, and processes of industry. We will accept the responsibilities that are ours and the theories that are supported by proper evidence. We will explore on our own for safer, more effective methods of working and living. We will strive to be fun and respectful. Through our work, we will express our ideas to the best of our ability. In short, we will strive to make the world a better place in which to live.</i></p>
    </div>
      <div id="community">
      <h1>Community Service</h1>
      <p>Ithaca High School TSA believes that our primary mission is to educate students about technology’s potential and the allure of being fluent in it. We believe that we can do the most utilitarian good in the world through this education, not through other means. As a result, we typically pay less attention to community service than one might expect of a TSA chapter.This isn’t to say that we ignore it. On September 12th, members of Ithaca High School TSA assisted as volunteers for the AIDS Ride for Life, a 100-mile bike race around Cayuga Lake that is also a fundraiser for money used to combat AIDS.Ithaca High School TSA members spent four hours directing bikers so they could navigate correctly—in weather that alternated between pouring rain and a steady drizzle. </p>

    <div id="officers">
      <h1>Officers</h1>
      <p>Ithaca High School is led by a team of six officers who run meetings and do long-term planning for the club.</p>
      <p>Zachary Stillman ‘16 is Ithaca High School TSA’s president, whose favorite TSA events are CO2 Dragster and Video Game Design. He’s also one of Ithaca High School’s most illustrious students, taking a multitude of AP and technology classes—in which he performs quite well. </p>
      <p>Jacob Silcoff ‘17 is the vice-president. Known for his jokes and radical (but effective) ideas, he’s always a colorful voice on the officer team’s Google chat. His favorite events are Video Game Design and Catapult, one that he’s done nearly every year since 7th grade. Jacob is a talented student, snowboarder, and as the captain of Ithaca High School’s debate team, a feared opponent in any debate.</p>
      <p>Ithaca High School TSA’s secretary is Tristan Engst, whose role on the officer team is apparently to make sure important things like registration happen on time. He also maintains an organizational regime over the officer team’s files—and as a result, they’re quite useful. Though he spends a large amount of time in TSA doing administrative work, Tristan does love to work on TSA events—Catapult and Webmaster in particular. Outside of TSA, Tristan is an editor at Ithaca High School’s student-published newspaper, The Tattler, a member of Ithaca High School’s Chemistry Club, a fencer, and a cross country runner.
      <p>Francesca Chu manages Ithaca High School TSA’s treasury. Though she can sometimes be quiet, her ideas are often extremely good. Her favorite events are Essays on Technology—in which she’s taken 1st and 5th at nationals—and Children’s Stories. In addition, Francesca is a stellar student and a member of Ithaca High School’s Brain Team and Mock Trial Clubs.</p>
      <p>Freya Ryd is our chapter’s Reporter. Her favorite events are Video Game Design and Photographic Technology (although she misses Techno-Talk from middle school, in which she was a two-time national finalist).Outside of TSA, Freya enjoys horseback riding and plays the violin. She is also an adept student, with a passion for learning about technology and especially science.</p>
