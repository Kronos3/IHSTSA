      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>The Ithaca High School Technology Student Association—IHSTSA—was for a long time overshadowed by Ithaca High School’s other technology clubs. However, for reasons that no one entirely understands, IHSTSA’s membership exploded in September 2015. Though we have always done well at the New York State Competition, this year we needed a long paragraph to list our awards. Gone are the times when we sent only eight members to Nationals—this year, we will send 20 and not everyone will get to go.</p>
      <p>Back home in Ithaca, we make up a significant fraction of Ithaca High School’s technology and science geeks:</p>

      <h1>Community Service</h1>
      <p>Ithaca High School TSA believes that our primary mission is to educate students about technology’s potential and the allure of being fluent in it. We believe that we can do the most utilitarian good in the world through this education, not through other means. As a result, we typically pay less attention to community service than one might expect of a TSA chapter.</p>
      <p>This isn’t to say that we ignore it. On September 12th, members of Ithaca High School TSA assisted as volunteers for the AIDS Ride for Life, a 100-mile bike race around Cayuga Lake that is also a fundraiser for money used to combat AIDS.</p>

      <p>Ithaca High School TSA members spent four hours directing bikers so they could navigate correctly—in weather that alternated between pouring rain and a steady drizzle.</p>
      <p>During early April, the IHSTSA officers journeyed to a local elementary school that was putting on presentation of technology for elementary schoolers around Ithaca. The officers brought a copy of the State-winning Children’s Stories Submission A Needle in a Haystack, some awards, an easy-to-complete technology problem solving challenge, and the State-winning <a href=”...” catapult></a>. Elementary schoolers loved to fire plastic golf balls from the catapult, and the officers hoped they’d garnered a few future recruits to TSA.</p>
      <p>In past years, we have always taken a day to trudge through the creek behind our school and pick up trash. We’ve found every type of junk from candy bar wrappers and plastic bags to that of the more exotic sort.</p>

      <h1>Fundraising</h1>
      <img class="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kronos3/Webmaster-Nationals/gh-pages/images/chocolate.jpg" >
      <p>With over 20 members eager to attend nationals, Ithaca High School TSA needs to raise thousands of dollars to pay for a bus to take ourselves, luggage, and great hopes for success to Nashville, Tennessee, for the Technology Student Association national competition. Much of the roughly $650 cost per student will be paid for by parents—but to offset this as much as possible, we see Gertrude Hawk chocolate bars to our fellow students for $1 per bar. Our most successful sellers have made hundreds of dollars on this.</p>

    <div id="officers">
      <h1>Officers and Advisors</h1>
      <p>Ithaca High School is led by a team of six officers who run meetings and do long-term planning for the club.</p>
      <p>Zachary Stillman ‘16 is Ithaca High School TSA’s president, whose favorite TSA events are CO2 Dragster and Video Game Design. He’s also one of Ithaca High School’s most illustrious students, taking a multitude of AP and technology classes—in which he performs quite well. Zak’s time in TSA is at an end, and we’ll all be sad to see him graduate and disappear off to UC Berkeley to study physics.</p>
      <p>Jacob Silcoff ‘17 is the vice-president of IHSTSA, and next year’s New York State TSA president. Known for his jokes and radical (but effective) ideas, he’s always a colorful voice on the officer team’s Google chat. His favorite events are Video Game Design and Catapult, one that he’s done nearly every year since 7th grade. Jacob is a talented student, snowboarder, and as the captain of Ithaca High School’s debate team, a feared opponent in any debate.</p>
      <p>Ithaca High School TSA’s secretary is Tristan Engst ‘17, whose role on the officer team is apparently to make sure important things like registration happen on time. He also maintains an organizational regime over the officer team’s files—and as a result, they’re quite useful. Though he spends a large amount of time in TSA doing administrative work, Tristan does love to work on TSA events—Catapult and Webmaster in particular. Outside of TSA, Tristan is an editor at Ithaca High School’s student-published newspaper, The Tattler, a member of Ithaca High School’s Chemistry Club, a fencer, and a cross country runner.</p>
      <p>Francesca Chu ‘18 manages Ithaca High School TSA’s treasury. Though she can sometimes be quiet, her ideas are often extremely good. Her favorite events are Essays on Technology—in which she’s taken 1st and 5th at nationals—and Children’s Stories. In addition, Francesca is a stellar student and a member of Ithaca High School’s Brain Team and Mock Trial Clubs. Next year she’ll be doing the same job for TSA, but this time for New York State TSA as the state secretary.</p>
      <p>Freya Ryd ‘17 is our chapter’s Reporter. Her favorite events are Video Game Design and Photographic Technology (although she misses Techno-Talk from middle school, in which she was a two-time national finalist). Outside of TSA, Freya enjoys horseback riding and plays the violin. She is also an adept student, with a passion for learning about technology and especially science, where she seems to always know more than anyone.</p>
      <p>Paul Fisher-York ‘18 is the quintessential computer nerd; he studies for 20 minutes before the AP Computer Science exam and finds it “not too hard.” In TSA, he whacks away at a computer keyboard, disassembles and reassembles his computer, and also acts as the sergeant-at-arms. He finds problems in our school’s security software. Paul is a the person critical for doing the best job IHSTSA can do in a computer-oriented event.</p>

      <h1>Submissions We’re Really Proud of:</h1>
      <h2>The “Unusual” Catapult</h2>
      <p class="quote">“They changed the rules! We don’t need to have a lever anymore! [Mwahahaha]”</p>
      <img class="right" src="images/cat.JPG">
      <p>This set four of our officers—Tristan, Zak, Jacob, and Freya—on a course to competing at the New York State Technology Student Association Catapult competition with a catapult modeled on those used to launch planes from aircraft carriers. By which the four really meant air cannon. The catapult’s “unusual” design and ability to make loud tooting noises attracted a lot attention at States. A fiasco resulting from the event rules being unclear caused the four to make a new barrel from duck tape, paper, and hot glue and install it only a few seconds before their turn to compete came. The barrel was also incompatible with the gravity-fed loading magazine that allowed for the planned rapid-fire mode.</p>
      <p>Even with all the planned advantages of the “unusual” design taken away, the four were still able to handily win the state competition. Sitting on their laurels, the device was the primary attraction when the IHSTSA officers went to promote technology at a local elementary school. The officers made sure all the children got a turn to fire the catapult—which was difficult, because it was so fun. And to be honest, aging doesn’t make pushing a small red button that makes a loud toot and sends three or four plastic golf balls 20 feet any less amazing.</p>
      <h2>Flight</h2>
      <p>Andrew was always quiet and studious. He also didn’t come to IHSTSA meetings often. So everyone was surprised when he brought a featherweight airplane to the New York State Technology Student Association Flight event, launched it, and it didn’t come down—for about two minutes. Andrew easily won first place, and IHSTSA members spent some time afterwards proposing increasingly strong ways to protect Andrew’s submission on its way to Nationals.</p>
      <h2>Children’s Stories:<i>A Needle in a Haystack</i></h2>
      <p>Last year, a team of IHSTSA students made it to the semifinals in Children’s Stories at the national competition, only to fail to make the final step to glory. This year, a team of the same core people is coming back with a vengeance with <i>A Needle in a Haystack,</i> a story about a girl who designs a complicated contraption to find her lost sewing needle. Their beautifully illustrated story is written with a (mostly) AABB rhyme scheme. But honestly, three pictures of the book tell more than three thousand words:
