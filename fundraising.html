        <h3>Fundraising</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="inner-wrapper-fund">
        <p>Again this year, we are preparing for our teams to travel to the National TSA Conference, the culmination of the  year’s work. We perennially field very competitive teams, and we hope to make our school and Ithaca proud again this year. This conference, as well as other expenses such as materials and national TSA fees, require significant financial support. Team members’ families contribute by far the largest share, and we also are very grateful for support from the Ithaca City School District.</p>
        <p>This year, IHSTSA has led various crowdfunding and fundraising programs. Our crowdfunding campaign sourced donations from a variety of generous people and small businesses around the community. These donors have helped our chapter raise thousands of dollars to help subsidize the cost for parents of paying for their children to go to the national conference. In order to extend our fundraising campaign, IHSTSA decided to pursue a new type of fundraiser with a small community business, Gimme Coffee. Students in IHSTSA work hard to sell bags of coffee and earn significant profits.</p>
        <p>One of the proudest moments of this year’s crowdfunding campaign was the creation of our chapter’s crowdfunding video. This video, put together primarily by chapter member Fiona Okumu, featured various members of the chapter. Using the TV production studio in the school, Okumu worked to interview various students about their TSA experiences in order inform our donors about what goes on in TSA. Many IHSTSA students and parents have found great pride in the production of this video.</p>
