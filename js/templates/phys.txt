~AP Physics C
-At Ithaca High School, the capstone course for high-achieving students in STEM is AP Physics C. This course, taught by Ms. Deborah Lynn, forms the beginning of a college-long sequence that serves as a basis for a career in physical science or engineering. As a result of the many prerequisite courses needed to take Physics C, nearly all students are seniors in high school, with the exception of a few precocious juniors. In order to take the course at Ithaca High School, students must be in a concurrent AP Calculus course. Since this physics course is the most rigorous level offered by the College Board, methods of calculus are used to analyze physical principles and answer physical problems. Surprisingly, Physics C is set apart from Physics 1 and 2 (also offered by the College Board for AP credit) because Physics C covers fewer topics, but emphasizes these concepts in greater depth and with greater mathematical sophistication. Above all, AP Physics C offers a rigorous curriculum that emphasized challenging, calculus-laden problems.
-When analyzing the curriculum of AP Physics C, one can break the subject matter into two main categories: mechanics, and the broader category of electricity and magnetism. Each category attempts to address a few main, broad goals:
<ol>
    <li>Develop a deep understanding of foundational principles of physics in electricity and magnetism by applying these principles to complex physical situations that combine multiple aspects of physics rather than present concepts in isolation</li>
    <li>Design and conduct inquiry-based laboratory investigations to solve problems through first-hand observations, data collection, analysis and interpretation</li>
    <li>Develop critical thinking skills through applying methods of differential and integral calculus to formulate physical principles and solve complex physical problems</li>
</ol>
-As a consequence of this categorization of the curriculum, Francesca Chu ‘18 finds that “AP Physics C is basically two classes in one: we learn about mechanics and electricity.”
-The semester-long mechanics component of AP Physics C is founded on classical mechanics and kinematics. These topics range from kinematics (including vector algebra, vector components, and velocity and acceleration) to Newton’s laws of motion. Newton’s laws of motion comprise by far the largest part of the mechanics curricula, filling 20% of the semester. At Ithaca High School, most students enter with basic knowledge of vectors, free-body diagrams, and laws of motion from either an engineering course or from the prerequisite course Advanced Precalculus BC. Consequently, Matthew Guo ‘18 finds, “you aren’t immediately in uncharted territory: everything just seems like a complex extension on some prior knowledge.”
-The second semester of AP Physics C explores the second category of the curricula, Electricity and Magnetism. In this section of the course, students can explore topics including electrostatics, conductors, capacitors, and dielectrics; and electric circuits,  magnetic fields, and electromagnetism. Although this semester introduces largely new material, some students have prior knowledge about electricity from the year-long elective Digital Electronics. In the second semester, calculus has an even greater emphasis when designing and solving problems.
