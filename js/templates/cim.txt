--Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM)
-In the world today, manufactured objects are the heart of our society and our consumer culture. While we may readily consume certain things, we rarely think about the path these objects travel to our homes, let alone in much depth.
-Ithaca High School is fortunate to offer the Project Lead the Way (PLTW) sequence, a set of five engineering courses. These courses are year-long and include a final examination. If a student receives an 80 percent or higher on the examination, the student is eligible to receive college credit from the Rochester Institute of Technology. Computer Integrated Manufacturing is the second course in the sequence and is traditionally taken by high school sophomores. As the name of the course suggests, students explore computer-controlled manufacturing processes in-depth—selective laser sintering (SLS) and fused deposition modeling (FDM)—and learn how to control lathes and mills with computer operations.
-Throughout the year, students will explore how everyday objects are made and designed. The year begins with an exploration of design and manufacturing processes: six sigma and lean manufacturing being the primary focus of study. Based on their knowledge of effective and cost-saving manufacturing processes, students embark on a project of their own. For half a semester, students will design and build a VEX automated guided vehicle (AGV) while acknowledging cost and time constraints. Consequently, students are forced to consider real-life engineering challenges in order to build a cost-effective AGV.
<p class="quote">“The project was really difficult. We had to consider our constraints—cost and material—while also maximizing the vehicle for efficiency. It’s impossible to build an efficient AGV without stronger and more expensive materials, but a careful balance to control the costs.”<span>—Junior Marvin Yang on the AGV project</span></p>
-In the second semester, students explore the namesake of the CIM course—computer integrated manufacturing processes. In perhaps the most impactful project of the year, students design and build a light-up acrylic desk sign. For past projects, students have laser-engraved pictures of their favorite dog or significant other. To create a sign, students first design the sign base in Autodesk Inventor and map a Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) operation to mill a block of base material. This requires knowledge about basic Computer Numerical Control (CNC) processes, and how to write G-code to be read by a milling machine. Students are allowed to take their final signs home as a memento from the course.
