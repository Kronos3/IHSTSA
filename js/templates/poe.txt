~Principles of Engineering (POE)
-The third course in the Project Lead the Way sequence, Principles of Engineering (POE) encourages students to explore the field of engineering and introduces students to major engineering concepts. Since Principles of Engineering requires a solid basis in trigonometry and college-preparatory mathematics and sciences, most Principles of Engineering students are juniors in high school.
-The year begins with a broad exploration of careers in engineering. For the first semester, students will go into a chosen field of engineering and conduct a comprehensive interview of an engineer working in that respective field. This interview is transcribed and supplements research on the field of engineering. All research and the interview transcript are consolidated into a single research paper subject to a final grade by the engineering teacher. Furthermore, this research paper is summarized in 15-minute powerpoint presentation. Throughout this project, students are encouraged to look at engineering disciplines on a holistic level and consider certain colleges that offer strong programs in the given field.
-Principles of Engineering also offers substantial time for hands-on learning and includes many projects which emphasize skills in science and mathematics. For one, students build and test balsa-wood bridges in a stress analyzer, a similar task to what can be found in the Structural Design and Engineering competitive event in TSA. In order to build an efficient and strong truss, students must show in-depth calculations for each member of the balsa truss, using knowledge about vectors and compression/tension forces in the process.
-On the whole, Principles of Engineering offers a valuable look into the life of an engineer, and introduces many of the same calculations and processes that engineers use on a daily basis. Tilden Chao ‘19 finds, “it’s rather interesting to see a different side of engineering— [POE] isn’t all calculations and designing, but actually a good look into the daily life, meeting schedule, and work duties of an average engineer.”
