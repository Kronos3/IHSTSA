~AP Chemistry
-At Ithaca High School, perhaps the most popular science course is AP Chemistry, taught by Mr. Bob Tuori. Mr. Tuori is known for his ebullient nature, and incorporates his personal energy into the course. Traditionally, juniors and seniors take the course, although a few precocious sophomores take the class.
-The key concepts that define the AP Chemistry course are organized around underlying principles called the “Big Ideas” of the College Board curriculum. “Big Ideas” attempt to include key scientific principles and chemical laws of nature. These main focuses include: arrangements of atoms, chemical and physical properties, changes in matter, and chemical reactions.
-With a foundation of Honors Chemistry prior to taking the AP course, Felix Shi ‘19 finds that “most material is a comprehensive extension of previous material, but we have to think about things in slightly different ways.” Exams in AP Chemistry often take the form of calculations and thought questions, in which one small mistake can throw off an entire problem.
<p class="quote">“Even though you have to be really careful on chemistry tests, taking the tests is surprisingly fun. It’s like the problem solving event—you come up with a solution based on the few materials (in this case equations and given values) to come up with an answer.”<span>—Junior Joseph Yoon on chemistry exams</span></p>
