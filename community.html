      <h1>Community Service</h1>
      <p>Ithaca High School TSA believes that our primary mission is to educate students about technology’s potential and the allure of being fluent in it. We believe that we can do the most utilitarian good in the world through this education, not through other means. As a result, we typically pay less attention to community service than one might expect of a TSA chapter.</p>
      <p>This isn’t to say that we ignore it. On September 12th, members of Ithaca High School TSA assisted as volunteers for the AIDS Ride for Life, a 100-mile bike race around Cayuga Lake that is also a fundraiser for money used to combat AIDS.</p>

      <p>Ithaca High School TSA members spent four hours directing bikers so they could navigate correctly—in weather that alternated between pouring rain and a steady drizzle.</p>
      <p>During early April, the IHSTSA officers journeyed to a local elementary school that was putting on presentation of technology for elementary schoolers around Ithaca. The officers brought a copy of the State-winning Children’s Stories Submission A Needle in a Haystack, some awards, an easy-to-complete technology problem solving challenge, and the State-winning <a href=”...” catapult></a>. Elementary schoolers loved to fire plastic golf balls from the catapult, and the officers hoped they’d garnered a few future recruits to TSA.</p>
      <p>In past years, we have always taken a day to trudge through the creek behind our school and pick up trash. We’ve found every type of junk from candy bar wrappers and plastic bags to that of the more exotic sort.</p>
