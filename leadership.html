		<h3>Mr. Breigle</h3>
		<p>IHSTSA is led by Mr. Scott Breigle, Ithaca High School Technology Department Head and renowned technology
			teacher. During the school day, Mr. Breigle teaches high-level courses in the Project Lead the Way sequence,
			such as Computer Integrated Manufacturing and Principles of Engineering. As a teacher, Mr. Breigle’s main
			goal is to spark interest and love for learning and to help students to develop practical skills in
			technology. On a deeper level. Mr. Breigle hopes to encourage students to pursue technology and STEM as a
			potential career.</p>

		<h3 style="margin-bottom: 30px">Mr. Breigle</h3>
		<p>Mr. Breigle’s interest in TSA and technology began early. After he won an event for CO2 dragsters in middle
			school, Mr. Breigle first realized his love for STEM disciplines and the field of engineering. While Mr.
			Breigle couldn’t see the purpose of many skills taught in math classes, he instantly recognized how
			applicable many skills taught in technology classes could be in the real world. Mr. Breigle went on to study
			teaching technology at SUNY Oswego, and then to get a master’s degree from the Rochester Institute of
			Technology.</p>
		<p>Luckily, Mr. Breigle joined IHSTSA and has worked with the chapter as a head advisor for one and a half
			years. To many students in the chapter, Mr. Breigle is special for his sheer dedication to the chapter. In
			many instances, Mr. Breigle has changed his schedule and went to lengths to find his young children
			childcare in order to work with students in TSA after hours.</p>
		<p>Mr. Breigle’s specific focus for IHSTSA this year is building a greater sense of family and community. “With
			so many students working in small or individual events, students sometimes work in isolation,” he said.
			Since so many students work on individual events, the focus for students can often be on their own success
			rather than the success of the entire team and chapter. TSA can be a highly competitive environment, but
			this year, students instantly have realized there is a greater sense of friendship and community in the
			chapter.</p>
		<p>When Mr. Breigle isn’t teaching or working on some tech-related thing, he devotes his time to golf, skiing, boating, and woodworking.</p>

			<h3>Ms. Kiechle</h3>
			<div class="render-svgs" data-svgs="quote"></div>
			<p class="quote">My increased interest in STEM happened when I started co-teaching in the technology and
				engineering classes. I have always liked science and have taught science, but co-teaching in the tech
				classes really stirred something in me.</p>
			<img src="img/kiechle.jpg">
		</div>
		<p>A few years ago, Ms. Kiechle served as a chaperone for the IHSTSA delegation at the TSA National Conference.
			Since then, her love of TSA has grown and she has added her special education students to the team. “To help
			support those students and because I like TSA, the students, and the experiences it offers students I became
			a co-advisor,” said Ms. Kiechle.</p>
		<p>This year, as Ms. Kiechle took on new administrative responsibilities, she found that the time she could
			spend on TSA became severely limited. However, she is still able to make many meetings and participate in
			many big decisions. Additionally, she noted that “It has worked out that [Mr. Breigle] is comfortable with
			taking the lead, so I can have increased flexibility with my level of participation.”</p>
		<p>Even if Ms. Kiechle allows Mr. Breigle take the lead on many projects, the chapter could not possibly
			function without her. IHSTSA members will fondly remember long nights with Ms. Kiechle in her national’s
			hotel room, messing with the printer to get a few lingering pages of information in their event binders. No
			matter how late or how long, Ms. Kiechle presents infectious positive energy that always keeps our members
			confident and motivated during meetings and conferences.</p>
		<p>In her extremely scarce free time, Ms. Kiechle enjoys spending time with her daughter and the rest of her
			family. Reading, shopping, painting, and woodworking are her favorite ways to spend time.</p>

			<h3>Francesca Chu</h3>
			<div class="render-svgs" data-svgs="quote"></div>
			<p class="quote">We need a quote here</p>
			<img src="img/pres.jpg">
		</div>
		<p>IHSTSA President, TSA extraordinaire, and exceptionally fun person—that’s Francesca Chu ‘18. Francesca joined
			TSA in 8th grade and later that year shocked everyone with a stellar performance at the National Conference
			in Washington D.C., where she won first place in Essays on Technology and finalized in several other events.
			What’s even more impressive is that her abilities haven’t slipped at all.</p>
		<p>Francesca favors arts-oriented events like Essays on Technology, Music Production, and Children’s Stories,
			telling us that she loves how she “can work on something STEM-related through writing, which isn't
			necessarily what you would expect.” Francesca is known for being incredibly talented with language, and is a
			formidable opponent in any speech and debate or writing competitions. Despite her language skills, Francesca
			has the greatest success in the Music Production event, where she has had two consecutive second-place
			finishes at the national level.</p>
		<p>In addition to working on TSA events, Francesca has traditionally managed IHSTSA’s finances since 10th grade
			as the club’s treasurer, until this year, when she handed off the reigns to Katrina Jander and Kasia
			Fadeeva. “I like being an officer because I like to help other people appreciate TSA as much as I do,” she
			said. Chu also serves as the New York State TSA Secretary.</p>
		<p>Outside of TSA, Chu is a member of the Ithaca High School Mock Trial and Quiz Bowl teams, as well as the
			layout editor of the school newspaper, The IHS Tattler. She enjoys baking, and reading and writing fiction.
			Chu also has a fictitious persona as the leader of The Tattler’s ninja-journalist investigative unit.
			Francesca will attend UChicago in September.</p>

			<h3>Eli Zhang</h3>
			<div class="render-svgs" data-svgs="quote"></div>
			<p class="quote">We need a quote here</p>
			<img src="img/vice.jpg">
		</div>
		<p>One of the most ebullient and outgoing members of the IHSTSA officer team, Vice President Eli Zhang ‘18 adds
			a unique feeling of energy to the chapter. Since 7th grade, Eli has accumulated a number of events in which
			he is a perennial contender. Most notably, Eli has two-straight second-place finishes in the Music
			Production event in Nashville and Orlando, respectively, wowing judges with smooth rapping about defining
			one’s future or having a vision for a future in STEM. Eli’s rapping first began in middle school, when he
			created a humorous and original rap to commemorate Pi Day.</p>
		<p>When Eli isn’t rapping or succeeding in TSA events, you could find him in his electronics-oriented room,
			soldering wires and circuit boards for his latest project, a custom desktop speaker. Eli is also captain of
			the Mock Trial team, and brings his eloquent and impactful speaking style to the attorney table. Eli mainly
			attributes his skills in speaking to TSA, which he claims “fostered his confidence when speaking and
			presenting.”</p>
		<p>Aside from engaging with Eli in some academic activity or project, another way to instantly become Eli’s
			friend is to express an undying love for samosas. Consistently, you could hear Eli exclaim how delicious a
			samosa is at his favorite downtown restaurant, Diamonds, or a sigh of satisfaction after eating the frozen
			samosas he can make at home. Whether it’s Music Production, samosas, or the vice presidency, Eli present
			unique energy and outlook that inspires even the youngest TSA members.</p>

			<h3>Katrina Jander</h3>
			<div class="render-svgs" data-svgs="quote"></div>
			<p class="quote">QUOTE</p>
			<img src="img/tres_one.jpg">
		</div>
		<p>During officer meetings, it isn’t a rare sight to see a senior member of the robotics team run into the room
			and ask for Katrina’s assistance to fix the plasma cutter or lathe. That’s because Co-Treasurer Katrina
			Jander ‘20 is a leading member of both Ithaca High School TSA and Ithaca Robotics. Last year at the National
			Conference in Orlando, Katrina won fourth place in the Structural Model event, and just a month before,
			participated in the National Robotics competition in St. Louis, Missouri.</p>
		<p>Aside from having a special touch with machines and balsa wood bridges, Katrina also has immense athletic
			prowess. Every night after robotics or TSA meetings, Katrina bikes miles to her home, up a steep hill which
			imparts fear in even the best drivers. Nevertheless, Katrina bikes, sun and rain, sleet and hail, sometimes
			even carrying a large backpack or musical instrument. Katrina also actively participates on the girls rowing
			team, with faster rowing split times than even the most motivated and confident boys on the team.</p>
		<p>Katrina takes this competitiveness and motivation to the table in TSA. When her balsa wood behaves strangely
			or her glue doesn’t set, she doesn’t bat an eye and stays cool, just like on the slopes or on the water. By
			contributing such infectious and motivational energy to the team, everyone can make meetings productive and
			exciting.</p>

			<h3>Kasia Fadeeva</h3>
			<div class="render-svgs" data-svgs="quote"></div>
			<p class="quote">Um… TSA is a lot of fun?</p>
			<img src="img/tres_two.jpg">
		</div>
		<p>One of the newest members of IHSTSA, Co-Treasurer Kasia Fadeeva ‘19 certainly doesn’t show it. In her first
			year in TSA in 2017, she won the CAD 3D event at the state competition, and constructed an incredibly
			impressive flight submission. Even though she is rather unassuming and reserved, Kasia is known to be one of
			the most talented members of the chapter.</p>
		<p>Aside from succeeding in IHSTSA, Kasia also runs the Ithaca Welcomes Refugees club, an organization designed
			to raise money to bring refugees to Ithaca. Moreover, Kasia has participated in Science Olympiad since
			middle school, and frequently brings her preexisting scientific knowledge to the table in TSA. When she
			isn’t working late nights at TSA, Kasia plays doubles on the varsity tennis team, and is a beloved team
			member wherever she goes.</p>

			<h3>Matthew Guo</h3>
			<div class="render-svgs" data-svgs="quote"></div>
			<p class="quote">I like TSA because it gives me a lot of experience in leadership and teamwork.</p>
			<img src="img/secretary.jpg">
		</div>
		<p>Surprisingly, you wouldn’t expect the soft-spoken Secretary Matthew Guo ‘18 to be the renowned “PolarBearr”
			on SoundCloud. In fact, Matthew’s musical brainchild—the IHS Music Production submission—consistently
			finalizes at the national conference. This year, Matthew hopes to improve his consecutive second-place
			finishes to a winning submission this year. By uploading his TSA submissions to SoundCloud, Matthew has
			slowly garnered public acclaim, with Music-Production hopefuls direct messaging him frequently for advice.
			On the Music Production team, Matthew is responsible for the beat and electronic production of music.</p>
		<p>When Matthew isn’t taking minutes in TSA or uploading hot new tracks to SoundCloud, he enjoys wrestling with
			problems in Math Club at the high school, and encourages underclassmen to join TSA.</p>

			<h3>Tilden Chao</h3>
			<div class="render-svgs" data-svgs="quote"></div>
			<p class="quote">It's a fun challenge to post and connect with people around the community.</p>
			<img src="img/reporter.jpg">
		</div>
		<p>The mind behind the IHSTSA Instagram aesthetic and Twitter profile, Reporter Tilden Chao ‘19 has a passion
			for succinct and informative social media posts and outreach to local organizations. At TSA conferences,
			Tilden puts his social media energies to use in the Extemporaneous Speech and Debating Technology Issues
			events, where he reflects on prescient and significant current events to explain social issues.</p>
		<p>Out of all members in TSA, Tilden may do one of the best jobs in competing in a breadth of events. “Because
			TSA offers so many great opportunities for students—robotics, dragsters, speech, and animation—I figure I
			should take advantage of what we are offered,” Tilden concludes. In fact, in his first time in the Computer
			Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) competitive event in Orlando, Tilden placed third at the national conference
			with the ProjectOrlando, a portable and collapsible smartphone projector.</p>
		<p>When Tilden isn’t working in the technology wing at the high school, you could find him a variety of
			extracurricular activities. Tilden actively participates in Student Council and plays alto saxophone in the
			Wind Ensemble and Jazz Band. His greatest musical highlight of the school year was “probably playing with
			Wynton Marsalis,” the director of Jazz at Lincoln Center and one of the most renowned contemporary jazz
			trumpeters in American history.</p>

			<h3>Andrei Tumbar</h3>
			<div class="render-svgs" data-svgs="quote"></div>
			<p class="quote">If it isn't broken, it doesn't have features.</p>
			<img src="img/sarge.jpg">
		</div>
		<p>Perhaps the officer whose personality most matches the duties of the office, Sergeant-At-Arms Andrei Tumbar
			‘19 always keeps chapter members on task with his loud voice and undying energy. Last year, the standing
			officers identified Andrei as a potential candidate for Sergeant-At-Arms after hearing him motivate at his
			Webmaster teammates. His voice (which can be heard even in adjacent hallways) lights up the room at the
			beginning and end of every chapter meeting.</p>
		<p>When Andrei isn’t keeping chapter members in line, he is the team hype-man for the varsity tennis team, and
			instills fear in even the most composed opponents, by shouting a blood-curdling “LET’S GO RED!” before every
			match. This year, Andrei hopes to bring the same energy to the national conference. Andrei finds “New York
			State is clearly marginalized and underrepresented at the national conference. I hope to lead all the cheers
			for our state and out-scream even Georgia and Florida at the general sessions. I think I can top them.”</p>
		<p>Although superficially Andrei may seem like an intimidating figure at meetings, he is actually a reserved
			intellectual when it comes to coding. Andrei spends hours at a time coding for his top-10-hopeful Webmaster
			project, once beginning to code upon sundown and being shocked when he saw the sun starting to rise.
			Moreover, aside from developing ways to make his website successful, he has also devised a method to improve
			his home to school commute. As a way to save energy and time, Andrei hops on the coal train that passes by
			the high school. With a free train fare, Andrei saves gas money and time in traffic.</p>
