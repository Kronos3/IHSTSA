        <h3>Mr. Breigle</h3>
        <p>IHSTSA is led by Mr. Scott Breigle, a new advisor this year. After a CO2 dragster sparked his interest in technology in 6th grade, he went on to study teaching technology at SUNY Oswego, and then to get a masters degree from the Rochester Institute of Technology. At the high school, Mr. Breigle teaches various technology courses including Computer Integrated Manufacturing and Principles of Engineering. Much beloved by his students, Mr. Breigle also is the Engineering Department Head.</p>

        <!--p>Luckily, Mr. Breigle agreed to work with IHSTSA at the end of last year and for the entire year this year. A father of young children, Mr. Breigle generously devoted his time to helping our students learn how to use new machines and develop new designs.</p>
        <!--p>Mr. Breigle’s specific focus for IHSTSA this year is building a greater sense of family and community. “With so many students working in small or individual events, students sometimes work in isolation,” he said. This year, students have certainly felt Mr. Breigle’s influence. As Felix Shi stated, “Mr. Breigle really helped to bring TSA together. This year, people are more devoted than past years and really take TSA seriously. It’s a great transformation that the club has experienced.”</p>
        <p>When Mr. Breigle isn’t teaching or working on some tech-related thing, he devotes his time to golf, skiing, boating, and woodworking.</p-->
