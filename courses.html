		<h1>Design and Drawing for Production</h1>
		<p>Design and Drawing for Production is an introductory engineering course for students. The course’s main focus is to teach the application of visualization processes and tools with computer aided design. Also, this course will emphasize the importance of the design process and technical sketching. Additionally, students taking this course can earn college credit from the Rochester Institute of Technology and can receive one fine arts credit, which is vital for graduating at Ithaca High School.</p>

		<h1>Computer-Integrated Manufacturing</h1>
        <p>Computer-Integrated Manufacturing, more commonly known as CIM is taken after Design and Drawing for Production. Students learn to use the skills that have already obtained from Design and Drawing for Production and apply them to more complex problems. Also, students learn about the relation between computers and manufacturing, using a CNC router in projects like making coasters. Additionally, the students will evaluate their solutions using mass property analysis and make modifications.</p>

		<h1>Digital Electronics</h1>
        <p>This course is mainly about Digital Electronics and studying applied digital logic. In this course, students will study the application of various electronic logic circuits and ways to apply Boolean logic to the solution of problems. Subsequently, students will learn to make prototype circuits that imitate clocks, traffic lights, and more.</p>

		<h1>Principles of Engineering</h1>
        <p>Principles of Engineering is a course usually taken along with Digital Electronics. This course is designed to assist students with their understanding about the field of engineering. Students will learn all about engineering and use engineering problem solving skills. The main question students ask themselves is, “Is a career in engineering or engineering technology right for me?”.</p>

		<h1>Engineering Design and Development</h1>
        <p>The final course in the PLTW curriculum is Engineering Design and Development or EDD. By far the most compelling STEM projects done at Ithaca High School happen in the Engineering Design and Development course, where students begin the year working in teams to build a boat from cardboard and one roll of duct tape to sail across the school’s pool. Most teams make it across. But the real fun starts later: teams of students come up with proposals for something to build throughout the year. At a banquet attended by the Ithaca City School District Superintendent Luvelle Brown, technology teachers, and representatives from nearby Cornell University, Ithaca College, and the Tompkins Cortland Community College, the teams present their ideas in an attempt to garner a fraction of the $2,000 alloted to the class. Having gotten funding, they begin work on their project.</p>
