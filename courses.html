<!--p class="course-intro">If a school taught only history, language, writing, and art, the engineers that graduated
	from it wouldn’t be well-prepared for their jobs—and the same would go for other STEM related professions. Thus,
	Ithaca High School maintains a top-notch STEM curriculum that allows alumni to study STEM subjects at top-tier
	colleges like UC Berkeley, Cornell University, Carnegie Mellon University, and the University of Illinois at
	Urbana–Champaign, among others.</p-->

		<p>This course is an introductory engineering course for students, which focuses on the application of
			visualization processes and tools with computer aided design to engineering. As with many engineering
			courses, the design process and technical sketching are also taught. Additionally, students taking this
			course can earn college credit from the Rochester Institute of Technology and can receive one fine arts
			credit, which is vital for graduating at Ithaca High School.</p>
